==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

A Fiori Elements application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their to-many associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the to-many associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

You help the user refining the DataModel for a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The DataModel consists of the following entities and associations:
- entity "Customers" (with to-many associations to "Purchases" and "Carts")
- entity "Products" (with to-many associations to "Purchases")
- entity "Purchases" (with to-one association to "Customers" and "Products" and "Discounts")
- entity "Carts" (with to-one association to "Customers")
- entity "Discounts" (with to-many associations to "Purchases")

Your task is to find the properties for each entity.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}

Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

==========LLM call for step "extractPropertyDetails":==========
Here is a list of property names, each with the property description that was extracted from previous user input:

Customers_name: The full name of the customer.
Customers_email: The email address of the customer.
Customers_customerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Customers_purchaseHistory: List of purchase transactions made by the customer.
Customers_membershipStatus: Indicates membership level (e.g., standard, silver, gold) based on cumulative purchases.
Products_name: The name of the product.
Products_description: A brief description of the product, highlighting key features.
Products_price: The price of the product.
Products_category: Category of the product (e.g., iPhone, iPad, MacBook, accessories).
Products_stockQuantity: Quantity of the product available in stock.
Products_sku: Unique stock-keeping unit identifier for tracking inventory.
Purchases_purchaseID: Unique identifier for each purchase transaction.
Purchases_purchaseDate: Date and time the purchase was made.
Purchases_totalAmount: Total amount of the purchase.
Purchases_customerID: ID of the customer making the purchase (foreign key).
Purchases_productID: ID of the product purchased (foreign key).
Purchases_quantity: Quantity of the product purchased.
Carts_cartID: Unique identifier for each cart session.
Carts_customerID: ID of the customer associated with the cart (foreign key).
Carts_items: List of items in the cart, including productID, quantity, and subtotal.
Carts_totalAmount: The total amount for all items in the cart.
Discounts_discountCode: Unique code for each discount offer.
Discounts_discountPercentage: Percentage off the total purchase.
Discounts_validityPeriod: Start and end dates for the discount offer.
Discounts_applicableProducts: List of product categories or specific products eligible for the discount.

For each property analyze the description with respect to what property values can be expected.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "properties": {
      "type": "array",

            "description": "Specific property values mentioned as part of the description. Those could be possible values or example values. Don't make up or invent any values"
          }
        },

The user input below describes the details of the ListReport page (i.e. its filters, tables or views with their columns).

Your task is to help the user defining the ListReport page.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

==========LLM call for step "extractSingleObjectPageOfMany":==========
The user input below describes a Fiori Elements Application with the following pages:
 - ListReport page for "Products"
 - ObjectPage for "Products"
 - ObjectPage for "Purchases"

Your task is to find the details of the ObjectPage for "Products".
The base entity of the ObjectPage is Products.
This ObjectPage can contain tabs and/or sections which in turn contain tables and fields.
It must contain table sections containing data for associated entity "Purchases" (via association Purchases);

The underlying data model allows the following propertyPaths:
 - name: Name (of Product)
 - description: Description (of Product)
 - price: Price (of Product)
 - category: Category (of Product)
 - stockQuantity: Stock Quantity (of Product)
 - sku: Sku (of Product)
 - Purchases/purchaseID: Purchase ID (of many associated Purchase)
 - Purchases/purchaseDate: Purchase Date (of many associated Purchase)
 - Purchases/totalAmount: Total Amount (of many associated Purchase)
 - Purchases/customerID: Customer ID (of many associated Purchase)
 - Purchases/productID: Product ID (of many associated Purchase)
 - Purchases/quantity: Quantity (of many associated Purchase)

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

==========LLM call for step "extractColors":==========
You help the user creating a Fiori Elements application based on user input describing such an application.
Your task is to determine whether the entity properties can be considered good and bad in most contexts or are usually neutral. When in doubt, set to neutral.

These are the entity properties and their values:
Entity: Customers, Property: membershipStatus, Values: standard, silver, gold
Entity: Products, Property: category, Values: iPhone, iPad, MacBook, accessories

If the properties can be considered good and bad, the allowed values for their criticality and the associated colors are:
   negative: red
   critical: yellow or orange
   positive: green
   neutral:  grey

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  Integer, Double: only numbers, no special symbols
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
  Decimal(3,2): 1.23
  DateTime: 2021-06-27T14:52:23Z
